# What is Firebase
Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Services mainly for mobile application. It is focused on removing the charge of programming the back-end providing a nice SDK as well as many other interesting things that facilitates the interaction between the application and the back-end.
Therefore, some Firebase endpoints could be found in mobile applications. It is possible that the Firebase endpoint used is configured badly granting everyone privileges to read (and write) on it.
I built two Script to search and exploit poorly configured Firebase databases
